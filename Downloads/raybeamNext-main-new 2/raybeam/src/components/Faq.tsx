        <AccordionContent>
        We only retain the information from your appointment request for our records and do not store any other details. All information you provide, including any credentials, will be deleted once your appointment is completed. However, for added peace of mind, we always recommend changing any credentials you've shared after the appointment.

        <AccordionTrigger>Can I get a refund for my appointment fee?{" "}</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
        Refunds for the appointment fee are generally not possible, as each investigation requires significant time and effort. Unless your appointment was not attended to or was rejected by us, we do not issue refunds if we've invested effort, even if weâ€™re unable to resolve the issue. The time our team dedicates to each case deserves fair compensation.
